Design Patterns
-
---
Welcome to the Design Patterns repository! 
This project provides clear, concise examples and explanations of classic design patterns described in the influential book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by the Gang of Four (GoF).

These patterns are proven solutions to common design problems in software development. 
Mastering them helps you write cleaner, more flexible, and maintainable code.

I've also added some Domain-Driven-Design patterns in the `others` folder.

What Are Design Patterns?
-
~~~ 
"A design pattern is a general, reusable solution to
a commonly occurring problem within a given context 
in software design."  — Gang of Four
~~~
They are not code templates, but rather best practices 
and architectural blueprints for solving recurring 
software challenges.
